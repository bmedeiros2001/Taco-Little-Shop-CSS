# 🌮 The Little Taco Shop - CSS Version

A responsive multi-page website for a fictional taco shop built with HTML5 and CSS3.

## 📖 About

This project takes my [HTML-only taco shop](https://github.com/bmedeiros2001/Taco-Shop-Website-HTML) and focuses on making it look good with CSS. The original project had all sections on one page, but this version separates each section into its own page and adds proper styling, animations, and responsive design.
